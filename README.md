# MARKDOWN PREVIEWER

### Markdown is a very simple markup language. Using the Markdown syntax we can turn plain text into HTML

For example creating a header with a short list is pretty easier with Markdown.

'# My Header
- List Item One
- List Item Two
- List Item Three'

### Just write above code in the editor box and the output will be shown in previewer box
